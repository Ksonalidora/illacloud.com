Thank you for your trust and support for ILLA. 2022 is a very important year for ILLA. ILLA Cloud was established this year, and the ILLA Cloud product was launched in September. In the past three months, we have made some good progress.

## Achievement

In these three months, we have received 4.3k stars on GitHub and have repeatedly entered the GitHub trending TypeScript and overall rankings. While gaining recognition from many developers, we have also gained a group of loyal seed users who have helped us improve ILLA and improve the experience.

On Hackernews, ILLA also ranked first in the weekly ranking in mid-November, attracting attention from overseas developers. The fact that ILLA can stand out from hundreds of product shares on HackerNews every day shows the recognition it has received. The popularity of ILLA has also made many programmers and companies abroad aware of the charm of low code.

## Partnership

We have also established a partnership with open-source data Pingcap, allowing our users to easily operate and use the Tidb database through a graphical interface. We have also partnered with many hot open-source projects and will be able to land more relevant partnerships next year.

## Community and social media growth

With the increasing number of likes on GitHub, our community has also become more active. Twitter fans have increased from 9 people in the team to 416, and the Discord community has also completed the 0-1 build, with a small channel of 376 partners from the initial silence to now. In the future, we will better operate our community and make users feel more supported by the community.

## Doc improvement and Blog release

To improve the user experience of ILLA, we have quickly improved product-related documents. We have improved the content of many documents at nodes where we often encounter problems such as deployment and use. In the next stage, we will provide more detailed explanations of the specific functions of ILLA.
In the last two months of 2022, our team wrote 25 blogs and greatly improved the user documentation for ILLA, allowing users to solve problems and learn how to use ILLA in the shortest amount of time.

## Multilingual support

In addition to Chinese and North American users, ILLA has also gained popularity among Japanese and Korean users. We ranked fifth in the Korean product sharing community and the proportion of Japanese users is steadily increasing. Therefore, we launched the Japanese and Korean versions of the product in December. Now, ILLA can support Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean languages more comprehensively.

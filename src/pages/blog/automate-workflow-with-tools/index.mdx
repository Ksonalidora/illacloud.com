Workflow automation has become quite common these days. There was a time when only large and wealthy corporations could afford this luxury. But nowadays, it has become quite common as many start-up companies and business users can afford these tools to take their venture to the next level.

<b>There are lots of different ways you can automate your workflow. You can use various tools to auto-approve workflows, enable robust integration of your work with other services, utilize cloud storage and services, etc. However, the best way to achieve automation is by using low-code platforms.</b>

If you are completely new to this and looking for an effective way to automate your workflow, you have come to the right place. We will walk you through some efficient ways to automate your workflow. We will also discuss the ins and outs of the best low code tool of the current time, ILLA.

## How To Automate Your Workflow?

As we have already discussed above, there are plenty of ways you can automate your business workflow. Adopting low-code solutions to build tools is one of many. Here are five ways you can automate your workflow:

### 1. Powerful Integration

If your workflow management system is unable to interact with other cloud-based services, it will be less effective. Integrating with other systems such as project and data management software, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and file-sharing platforms — can guarantee that your operations run smoothly.

Automation tools provide the integration you need to operate your business seamlessly. CRM systems, file sharing sites, data management, etc.—everything needs to be on the same page for effortless business management. By using workflow automation tools, you can make sure of that.

### 2. Automatic Approval Of Workflows

You've probably encountered bottlenecks in corporate operations. Without a suitable approval system, delayed approval will occur regardless of how efficiently you run your operations. It could be a late reimbursement check, lost time-off request, or something else.

By using an automated approval procedure, you will not only save time, and reduce irritation, but you will also improve productivity and save money. An automated approval system will also spare you the annoyance.

### 3. Remote Access

The digital transformation has reshaped various work habits and the way corporations function. Nowadays, remote work has been increasing in popularity. Workers prefer access to data and other relevant work tools. Many prefer to work from home.

Due to the nature of work models these days, workflow automation software should include mobility and collaboration features. This will allow users to take full advantage of this new work culture. You can make use of workflow automation platforms to allow remote access to various work-related data and information and also enable real-time sharing.

### 4. Cloud Storage

A robust cloud infrastructure relieves the user of various troublesome maintenance works. These maintenance works include but are not limited to server maintenance, Internet link acquisition, environment administration cost, maintenance, etc.

The initial expense is just the beginning. Maintenance and support bear a hefty cost that is sometimes disregarded throughout the buying process. Cloud computing can make changes to this scenario. Maintenance expenses are shared among all customers under the cloud model.

Proper cloud infrastructure is one of the key elements of automated workflow. You can adopt cloud-based data storage to minimize cost and streamline workflow.

### 5. Security And Authentication

You wouldn't want to share all information with everyone involved in a specific process or workflow.

A smart workflow management technology provides extensive safeguards to guarantee that only authorized individuals with the appropriate responsibilities have access to the required information.

### 6. Low Code Platforms

Implementing technology in your work isn't easy. There are a lot of technical aspects that most people, including your employees, won't easily comprehend. Whether they are technically skilled or not, coping with a brand-new system isn't a walk in the park.

Low code and no code platforms are here to solve that problem. You can use these platforms to develop internal tools for your business easily without any coding knowledge. Not only that, but your employees can also understand the nitty-gritty of these tools without having coding skills because they are made for general people, people with no coding skills. Low code development platforms are a great way to automate your workflow.

ChatGPT is a powerful chatbot that uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user input in a personalized and human-like way. With its ability to understand and respond to user input in multiple forms, including text, voice, and even images and videos, ChatGPT provides a convenient and intuitive way to interact with a computer or device.

Additionally, ChatGPT's ability to maintain context across multiple conversations allows users to have more natural and engaging interactions, and its ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously makes it a valuable tool for multitasking and productivity. Furthermore, ChatGPT can be customized and trained to specific domains and tasks, enabling it to provide more personalized and relevant responses to user queries. All these features and capabilities make ChatGPT a popular choice among users who want to enhance their user experience and make their interactions with computers and devices more efficient and effective.

## REST API

A REST API is a web-based service that uses the REST architectural style to provide access to data and functionality from other applications or services. It provides a standardized and flexible way to access and interact with web-based services and applications. ILLA has a REST API action built in. This means that developers can easily integrate these services and applications with the tools they build in ILLA, and users can access and use the data and functionality provided by the REST API consistently and predictably.

## What can you do with ChatGPT in ILLA?
Using ChatGPT as a chatbot for ILLA's users was my first impression. However, ChatGPT is a large and powerful language processing model with many potential uses beyond chatbots. Some of the other potential applications of ChatGPT include:

- Language translation: ChatGPT has the potential to improve the performance of machine translation systems, making them more accurate and natural-sounding.
- Summarization: ChatGPT could automatically summarize long pieces of text, such as news articles or research papers.
- Text generation: ChatGPT could generate creative and interesting text, such as poetry, fiction, or even music lyrics.
- Question answering: ChatGPT could be used to answer a wide range of questions, from simple factual questions to more complex ones requiring common sense knowledge.
- Sentiment analysis: ChatGPT could automatically analyze text sentiment, such as whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral.
- Text classification: ChatGPT could automatically classify text into different categories, such as spam, fake news, or sensitive content.
- Code Generator: ChatGPT could use natural language to create simple SQL queries. It can also do it in a reverse way, translating the code into a natural language for users to understand the code.

We use the REST API in ILLA to build out a feature to generate text based on our command. This can help our users to save time on copywriting and other heavy-texting work.  As you can see, the quality of the copywriting in the tips is beyond good. All you need is to describe the text you want and ChatGPT will generate such a paragraph for you.


## How to use ChatGPT in ILLA
[//]: # ()

### Connect to OpenAI

#### Create a REST API Resource to connect to OpenAI

Enter the **app editor** > click **+New** in Action List > select **REST API** > click + **New Resource** > enter the connection information and name it **OpenAI**.
<img
  src={require('./img/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-02.png').default}
  alt="discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-02"
/>

#### Query the REST API
After creating the resource named OpenAI, **create an action** with it and name the action **OpenAIConnection** > change the **action type** to **POST** > edit the **Body** > **Save** the action
<img
  src={require('./img/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-03.png').default}
  alt="discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-03"
/>
The body is as follows:

```
{{
{
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "prompt": "Write a creative ad for the following product to run on facebook aimed at "+ input1.value +":\n\nProduct: " + input2.value,
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "top_p": 1.0,
  "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
  "presence_penalty": 0.0
}
}}
```

### Build an Ad copy generator
Add two input components to enter the product information. We have called the data in **OpenAIConnection** via **input1.value** and **input2.value**
<img
  src={require('./img/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-04.png').default}
  alt="discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-04"
/>

Add components (such as input and table) to display the result, and set data of the components. For example, we add an input component, and set the default value as {{OpenAIConnection.data[0].choices[0].text}}. Or add a table component and set the data as {{ OpenAIConnection.data[0].choices }}.

### Use OpenAI in other businesses
Create solutions or tips for some common problems in your app with OpenAI
<img
  src={require('./img/discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-05.gif').default}
  alt="discover-the-power-of-chatgpt-05"
/>

The body is as follows:
```
{{
{
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "prompt": button3.text,
  "temperature": 0.5,
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "top_p": 1.0,
  "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
  "presence_penalty": 0.0
}
}}
```


## Conclusion
In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful and versatile language processing model that has the potential to significantly improve the performance of many different types of natural language processing applications. Its impressive size and capabilities make it well-suited for use in a wide range of applications, including chatbots.

The use of ChatGPT in ILLA can provide many benefits, such as generating more natural and varied responses and handling a wider range of questions and topics. However, challenges and limitations are associated with using ChatGPT in a low-code platform, such as the cost and complexity of training and deploying the model and the potential risks of using a large language model in a sensitive application.

Overall, the future potential of ChatGPT in ILLA and other low-code development platforms is promising. Still, it is also important to carefully consider the challenges and limitations of using the model in these contexts. With the right approaches and strategies, ChatGPT has the potential to significantly improve the performance of text-generating and other natural language processing applications.

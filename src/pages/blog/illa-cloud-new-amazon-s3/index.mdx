Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service) is a service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 manages data with an object storage architecture that aims to provide scalability, high availability, and low latency with high durability.

There are many advantages of Amazon S3:
- Provides a unified interface REST/SOAP to uniformly access any data
- Data stored in S3 is the object name (key), and the data (value)
- Large file capability, up to 5TB for a single file
- High speed. Up to 3500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5500 GET/HEAD per second per bucket
- Capable of version and authority control
- Capable of data lifecycle management

In ILLA's 1.40 Version, we started to support S3. The ILLA S3 Resource can connect to Amazon S3, Upcloud, Digital Ocean Spaces, Wasabi, DreamObjects, MinIO, and any other S3 provider. Below, you will see examples of connecting to your S3 provider and issuing List, Create, Read, and Delete actions.

The S3 Resource requires the following information to establish a connection:

For Amazon S3, you can find your Access Key and Secret Key using the following guide: Accessing AWS using your AWS credentials

And the following optional information:
1. Bucket name( used to specify the bucket )
2. Custom S3 endpoint ( used to connect to other non-S3 services, like Digital Ocean Spaces,  Wasabi, and so on )

## Configure actions

### List all objects in a bucket

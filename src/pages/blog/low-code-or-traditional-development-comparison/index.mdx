ILLA cloud offers the developer more freedom to implement the improved functionality via JavaScript, wrapping JS statements to place at any string type variable spaces for increased variety in output. Integrate with any source of data. ILLA will connect the database or linked data via APIs and increase actions to chain the user events. The software integrates the data obtained through the backend with components at the front end, permitting the developers to write simple data calls involving massive information interaction.

## Low Code

This is a contemporary approach for the development of applications where the users will build a powerful customized application through drag-and-drop components of UI and ready connectors. The Low code application is the standard tool for the internal teams of firms and businesses to experiment with app building and provide vision to the insights. This is a process of visual app development where the users design the front using drag-and-drop ready UI blocks, ready connectors database, ready business blocks of logic regarding workflows and action, one-click deployments, and validations.

These low-code helps in the visual development of applications through graphic interface and modeling. It enables the developers to deliver applications quickly by removing the complexity that comes with hand-coding. The platform works to improve the user experience of users.

## Traditional Development

There are many aspects of software development emphasizing the logic of the back end, databases, servers, architecture, and Programming interface. Concluding on the methodology to follow the Agile development, RAD, Waterfall, and Traditional application development is the approach towards the software development in which engineers need to code from scratch. Such an approach demands working in a team of programmers to collect specific requirements, design a development plan and work closely with a team to create some custom code.

Such an approach is good for building dream applications, but projects are usually more complex and time-consuming. Additionally, a motivated team needs to maintain and keep the application up-to-date. The traditional solution offer increased scalability. The developers will improve the app according to the requirements. As the code is written from scratch, the applications are scalable and portable from inception. This app also offers an increased level of customization. The customer will get any functionality or feature they like.

### Comparison

#### 1. Developer Skills

Low-code Platforms will be used by developers who are beginners and experts. The experts will experiment with different components to create customized applications while the beginners attain the best support for making an application without any complexity and hassle.

Similarly, traditional coding appeals to experts with increased technical skills. Hence, professional web developers with contemporary coding skills are employed to build applications. In the case of operating these applications, the user needs to be trained plus understand the knowledge in the domain.

#### 2. Tools (user interface)

The low codes support the users of the business, citizen developers, and developers to build the applications rapidly, showcasing the vision. The Low code progresses and is developed through tools like DronaHQ. For the traditional development process, there are no specific tools. The IT engineers use the framework plus programming language to hand-code applications.

#### 3. Customization:

The developers will easily customize the applications to showcase the brand value, ideas, and vision with various prebuilt facets provided through platforms. The traditional approach offers increased customization as applications are coded from the base to meet specific requirements.

#### 4. Agility

The low code solutions advance agility as one can make variations quickly and easily. With updated features, automated testing, and reusable templates, the developers can accelerate the procedure of creating an app. Low code applications will also be used for advanced and retouched with no difficulty. The application designed through the traditional approach is less agile than low-code solutions. The changes or updates in the application are slow and demand a dedicated team to update the variations every time.

#### 5. Quality

The low-code applications provide standard performance. Along with this, the services are error-free with live correcting plus integrating seamlessly with different productivity tools. The usual solutions are scalable at an increased rate, blending well with the remaining applications. The speed and performance are high, but testing and correcting require time.

#### 6. Deployment:

The solution of low code will be deployed across different platforms rapidly. Moreover, This can work effectively in a cloud environment. Developers should develop web and mobile, such as the application created through traditional approaches separately for every platform.

#### 7. Maintenance:

The Low code solutions are easy to maintain. All low-code apps will be updated automatically when the firm edits the low-code platform. There are fewer expenses for regular maintenance. The traditional solutions are complex to maintain and regularly update. Because of complex coding, one needs to have a dedicated team to edit the code. Consequently, the system updates the Low-code applications more frequently.

Today you must look for the most efficient solution to get things done. When developing software, the most efficient way is to use some internal tool builder instead of hiring a team of expert software engineers. However, selecting the right one is very important because there are several trending tools, and only the right ones can help you through the process.

## How to pick your best internal tool builder?

Here are the top 8 qualities to look for when selecting one of the best internal tools like Appsmith competitors.

### 1. Drag and drop software building

Fast software development is the first thing you need from the low-code platform, and it comes with drag-and-drop functionality. It is a quality that ensures that developers save 90% of the time they would otherwise waste by manually designing the software's user interface.

Here different components are available as building blocks that can be assembled to make your desired software while including all the critical functionalities you need.

### 2. Visual modeling

The best low-code platforms will make development easier by removing complex programming code lines and replacing them with visual models. Thus, the development process becomes understandable for individuals with less experience and knowledge. Through visual modeling, you only need to focus on the business logic, and there is no need to worry about the syntax, as the open-source low code platform takes care of it.

### 3. Collaboration

Today most software needs teams to work instead of a single developer because of project requirements and scope. With more than one person working on a project, the SaaS platform must offer great collaboration features.

With the right collaboration features, the productivity of the whole development team will exponentially increase as everyone will be on the same page. Everything will become efficient with the right collaboration experience, from testing to error resolution and updates.

### 4. Scalability

Software developed with a good quality low code platform will support workflow for hundreds and thousands of users without any performance issues. You can start with no growth plans, and the software will scale as you grow. It is a quality that makes your software reliable and highly manageable.

Along with the scalability feature, you will also have permission control for your software, where you will decide which users have what permissions in your application.

### 5. Security

Meeting the latest security protocols is necessary for these low code development platforms. The right platform will encrypt all the connections and credentials its stores. Additionally, the right platform must not store most of the data you use with your software and must serve only as your proxy. Regarding security and reliability, a good platform will maintain audit logs so you can go through them whenever needed.

### 6. Easier deployment

Easier deployment is another important feature. If the development part is nothing less than building a LEGO structure with all building blocks, but the deployment part is complex, then the low-code platform will be useless to most users. The right platform will bring several deployment choices so users use the option that offers them the best experience

### 7. App lifecycle management

Testing, hosting, and good low code development platforms must support debugging. With the built-in version control features, you can roll back to previous versions, which helps in application lifecycle management to maintain a much better user experience.

### 8. Feature-rich development with templates

The low code platforms must focus on feature-rich development with templates. With building blocks available for every feature and UI template, the development process will become significantly short and easy for the developer. Anyone with little to no knowledge about development can develop their business app with such software.

## How ILLA brings the best value for you?

With ILLA, you can accelerate the internal tools development process because it helps you develop and deploy internal tools within minutes. You will be spending much less time on the design and integration of your website with ILLA. Here is how it brings the best value for you compared to Retool alternative options.

### Brings freedom to every developer

Every developer can enjoy a higher degree of freedom when implementing richer functionalities in the application. There are no skill or expertise requirements here, and developers can use JavaScript wrapping the JS statements with the {{Template Syntax}} that allows placing any string data type variable to get more variety in the output for their code.

### Best-in-class collaboration features

The collaboration experience with ILLA is like no other. It supports real-time collaboration where developers work together simultaneously, communicate, give feedback, edit, and improve the overall project for higher efficiency. All of this is done here by simply sharing links.

### UI library with dozens of components

There is a UI library full of UI components developers can use for different parts of their low code software. These components can be used with the drag-and-drop functionality for quick UI design and efficient development that comes with boosted productivity.

### Deployment on your terms

ILLA provides a flexible deployment experience where users can deploy on their terms. There are 4 ways of deployment here which are:

1. ILLA cloud deployment is done with one click and works on all applications. It offers the easiest experience

2. ILLA CLI is the fastest and safest way to deploy with CLI for free

3. You can deploy ILLA into Kubernetes using the Helm chart if needed

4. Docker can be used for deploying your ILLA low code software in 5 minutes

### Efficient data connection and processing

ILLA allows integration with any data source, including sources of data connected with APIs or mainstream databases. Developers can then add automated actions against user events to get better interaction.

Apart from that, the internal data connection and processing are also exceptional here. The data obtained from the software backend is tightly integrated with its front-end components. So, simple data calls can instantly extract information.

With all these features, ILLA is undoubtedly your best choice as a low code development platform. So, stop going for inefficient software development ways that waste resources like money and time and go for low code development with ILLA with a great user experience.

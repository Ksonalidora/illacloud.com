Low code development means that instead of writing the whole program for software, users can use pre-built components as building blocks and assemble them to form software that meets their demands. When made correctly, such platforms lack no features and act perfectly on all commands.

## 8 Key Benefits of Low Code Platform

Going with a low code platform can bring several benefits to your business. Below are the top 8 benefits you must know.

### 1. Almost instant prototyping

Prototyping is an important early step in software development. With low code development using some Retool alternatives, you can quickly develop prototype solutions that can be evaluated, tested, and refined over time while using the same low code development trending these days. Whether you accept or reject the prototype, the development workflow will be much fast and more efficient.

### 2. Software development democratization

Going with some Appsmith competitors for low code development brings Democratization. The users can use internal tools to access technical features like machine learning or data analysis while developing.

It does not need you to be a senior developer with specialized tools from GitHub repositories to integrate such complex features. Thus, with the help of low code and SaaS, anyone can develop MVP software.

### 3. Reduction in entrepreneurship barrier

Developing and testing software has become easier, more accessible, and quicker. For most entrepreneurs, software development was the biggest barrier to launching their product in the market.

However, this barrier is now solved as everyone can use Opensource technologies with low code development platforms to launch their software without requiring huge investments or waiting for software development to complete.

### 4. Lesser maintenance requirements

There is a low maintenance burden on the development team because of the standardized components. As the whole software is made with building blocks, there will be no need for in-depth maintenance as the platform will take care of most of the maintenance stuff.

Thus, developers can focus more on bringing innovative features and offering a better user experience to every user on their platform.

### 5. Less CapEx and OpEx

Starting with the software used to take a lot of investments. Not only were the capital expenditures huge, but the operational cost was also huge for most businesses to manage. Through low code development, both expenses significantly reduce as there is no need to manage onsite hardware. Similarly, there is no need of It team or expert developers. Low code development also saves much time that would be used to write and test scripts or research different technologies.

### 6. Quicker automation

Businesses can easily automate most of their workflow with low code development using the right internal tools. This development mode will already have better development speeds, and when templates are used, new processes can be developed with automated workflows. Prebuilt APIs and integrations make It extremely easy to achieve, allowing anyone to automate any business process digitally and virtually.

### 7. Better productivity

This development mode bridges the gap between business and IT teams so both teams can work together, resulting in better overall business productivity. As the business team can develop their application without needing expert developers, launching new ideas and features becomes quicker. It also helps the software get mature more quickly.

### 8. Rapid iterations

With evolving business needs, low code development provides rapid iteration experience so developers can edit their existing processes without needing documentation or providing app revision history. So, changes in every iteration can be made exceptionally quickly.

It not only helps in quick changes, but testing also gets quicker, ensuring your application's perfect performance while running into production.

## Why is ILLA your best choice?
If you are also looking to entail all these benefits of low code development, then you need the right low code development platform. ILLA is the best choice as it accelerates your development by building feature-rich tools within minutes. ILLA provides everything you need, from better design to have all the necessary integrations.

### Allows integration with any data source
Integrations hold the highest importance for low-code software. With ILLA, you can connect any mainstream database to your software. It even allows connecting any data through APIs to your software. ILLA uses a tight data bonding technique between front-end and back-end components.

For this, developers have to write simple data calls, and achieving massive information becomes simpler for the developers this way. ILLA supports adding actions to chain the user events on your software to improve the interaction experience.

### An extensive UI library
ILLA builder has a fully responsive and extensive UI library. It consists of dozens of components so that every developer finds the necessary components while building different software features. The best part is its drag-and-drop functionality that significantly boosts developer productivity by saving time and building everything on the internal tool, further helping to make low-code software development quicker.

### Real-time collaboration
Real-time collaboration at ILLA takes low code development to the next level. It allows a team of developers to work on the same projects simply by sharing their work links. It means that a front-end developer may not have to wait for the back-end developer so they can connect and test things.

This real-time collaboration enhanced communication, editing, and feedback which significantly improved efficiency for the whole development lifecycle.

### Flexible deployment experience
Deploy on your terms with ILLA. It provides 2 ways to deploy your low code software, which are:

1. Use the ILLA cloud with a one-click deployment feature on any device with the easiest and quickest deployment experience available at ILLA.
2. Go with ILLA CLI, which comes for free and brings better security to ensure data integrity for your application. It is the fastest and safest way to self-host at ILLA.

Apart from these options, you also get less convenient options like Docker and Kubernetes for deploying your low code ILLA applications and software.

So, if you are looking to start with a low code platform, you need to try ILLA. Go for a live demo or try self-hosted services and begin developing your low code software within a few minutes.

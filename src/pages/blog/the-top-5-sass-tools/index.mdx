Developing software is becoming easier than ever, thanks to low-code development platforms. With these platforms, developers can create fully-functional applications without having to code from scratch. However, there are so many low-code platforms to choose from, which makes it hard to know the exact tool that suits your needs.

That is why I have created this comprehensive guide comparing the top low-code development tools that you can choose from if you wish to create apps without coding them from scratch. By the end of this article, you will have a clear idea of which tool you should use to do your next low-code project. Without any further ado, let’s jump right in!

## 1. ILLA

ILLA is an open-source low-code development tool that enables developers to build internal tools within a few minutes. With this tool, you will spend less time on websites and integrations and focus more on the core functionality of the tools you are building. If you are searching for a way to create internal apps much faster, ILLA is one of the best platforms you should consider.

It is fairly priced and comes with all the core features you will need to build fully functional tools for your business. ILLA also has an intuitive user interface that makes it easy to use for both experienced developers and beginners who don’t much about writing code. Let’s explore some of the features that make ILLA a reliable low-code platform.

### ILLA core features

#### Drag and drop builder
ILLA builder comes with drag-and-drop functionality, allowing developers to create different sections of their app by dragging and dropping pre-built components. This boosts productivity and reduces the time needed to create and ship apps to real users.

#### Integrate with any data source

ILLA also allows developers to connect to the mainstream databases or any data connected through APIs and add actions to chain to user events. It seamlessly connects data obtained from the back end of the application with front-end components. This allows developers to write simple data calls to achieve massive information interaction between the front-end components and the core functionality of the app in the backend.

#### Collaboration

One of the many benefits of using ILLA builder is real-time collaboration. This tool allows developers to simultaneously create and edit different sections of their applications. ILLA also allows developers to communicate and share useful information without having to leave the platform.

#### Multiple components

ILLA comes with dozens of components that developers can drag and drop to create different sections of their applications. Despite having these pre-coded components, ILLA Cloud allows developers to edit the code if needed. So, you can fully customize your app to make it look different from everyone else that has used similar components.

#### Flexible deployment

ILLA provides developers with different options to deploy their apps. With ILLA cloud, developers can enjoy a one-click and easiest deployment experience. It also supports ILLA CLI, which enhances security to ensure data safety.

#### ILLA pricing

ILLA cloud is fairly priced when compared to the competition. It also has a free version with limited features that you can get started with if you don’t intend to build a very sophisticated app.

#### Summary

Overall, ILLA is a reliable open-source low-code platform that anyone with basic computer skills can use to build online tools for their business. ILLA’s multiple components that you can drag and drop and the ability to connect to most databases make it the ideal solution for businesses looking for a reliable solution to create their internal tools much faster.

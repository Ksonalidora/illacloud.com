No-code development is a rapidly growing method of programming that is becoming increasingly popular among businesses, entrepreneurs, and individuals. No-code development is simple: it allows people to create web apps, automate tasks, and organize data without needing traditional coding knowledge. With the advent of natural language processing, drag-and-drop interfaces, and user-friendly code development platforms, it's easy to create custom web applications.

One of the most significant benefits of no-code development is allowing more people to participate in the app development process. Traditional code development tools often require a team of skilled developers in specific programming languages.

However, no-code development platforms allow more individuals to participate in the development process, including project managers, business analysts, and other non-technical staff. This is because no-code development platforms are designed to be easy to use, even for those who don't have a background in coding. Let's see some of the top no code tools!

## ILLA

In addition, working with such a tool requires just a single person to operate it, while other tools require a whole new team. Operating ILLA does not need a person to understand complex events, as using the platform is relatively easy.

#### Cons

One of the most significant limitations is linked to the templates they provide to the developers. By default, such templates have a specific range of functions and features, and the developers get restricted to them.

Therefore, when they need certain functions, and it's not available on the template, it might cause a problem for the developers. The app is helpful for applications that aren't complex. A full-fledged application requires a perfect learning curve, which is impossible with ILLA.

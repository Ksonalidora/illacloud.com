The world of open-source tools is progressing at lightning speed. We can see the developers generating innovative ideas and new internal tools development platforms open for other programmers to customize for their use. We can see open-source tools replacing many old big players in the development and internal tools market. We have Adobe Workfront alternatives, Mavenlink alternatives, virtual event platforms, and many other tools related to every field.

Many promising open-source projects are evolving and proving to support the developer fraternity, such as low-code open-source development environments.

Let us move on and see the fast-growing open-source projects in 2022, how you can incorporate them into your workspace, and how you can contribute to these open-source projects.

## 1. ILLA

/>
ILLA is an open source low-code platform for developers. It is a comprehensive development platform with APIs to integrate design, interactions, SaaS, and databases. It supports the developers in integrating the data fetched from the database to the frontend components. These APIs make the overall development and programming very convenient because the programmer can simply call the function to achieve the backend tasks.

ILLA is becoming the most preferred development environment for beginners and experts alike because of the easy learning curve. It has simple API calls and drag-and-drop design elements that help the developers to focus more on the business logic.

### Product Features

#### Responsive UI library

ILLA follows the latest web standards and offers an extensive library of responsive design. You can create custom themes and application templates with responsive touch-based/click-based user interfaces. There is much room for customization for forms, buttons, colors, navigation bars, etc. Integration with JavaScript code is also possible.

#### Real-Time Collaboration

Real-time collaboration in ILLA builder is done through sharing of links between the developers. They can edit the same code together and communicate the changes to others in real-time. So, it saves both time and effort for the team.

#### API & Database Integration

You can integrate third-party APIs, databases, and other tools to design a fully functional application using the method calls in the ILLA code. The developer has more freedom and functionality using very less code. Hence, they can focus more on their business logic.

#### Easy Deployment and Automation

ILLA solutions can be deployed as self-hosted or cloud-hosted solutions using Kubernetes and Docker. ILLA regularly optimizes the cloud-based solution to provide developers with a seamless and smooth experience. In automation support, ILLA allows you to connect and schedule jobs.


### Upgrade Features

ILLA has a continuous commitment to evolution and improvement. So, we see new component libraries and features added to ILLA, polishing it with every update.

### Pricing

ILLA is open-source software that is free to use, copy, study, and update. However, you will be charged for ILLA cloud hosting for your applications.

### Clients & Customers Testimonial

“ILLA is a new experience for my team and me. We decided to use it for a new project and found it very convenient. It covers the whole development process with a 360 view. We are impressed with UI design's drag and drop feature, seamless API integration, and cloud hosting. " -Anne Mehta.

“I have used both ILLA Builder and ILLA design for my new project. I will be using ILLA builder again because it saves me a lot of effort, and I can assemble a complete working application within hours. I am a newbie in development.” -Daniel

## 2. Appwrite

## Conclusion

Open-source software is getting more popular and has become a status that many low-code platforms are now challenging the big leaders. Interestingly developers are having the time of their life because they are contributing to their developer community with free code and platforms to encourage collaborative working. The technology is going so fast that even open-source platforms have alternatives like Retool alternative, Supabase alternatives, etc.

We discussed the top fast-growing open-source development internal tools, including ILLA, Appwrite, Retool, Figma, etc., with each targeting angle. The broad base development platforms like ILLA cover the complete cycle of application development, including UI design, business logic, data retrieval and manipulation, automation, and API access. It also covers part of project management with deployment options, real-time collaboration, and automation processes.

In order to improve many facets of their operations, modern businesses heavily rely on technological support. In fact, in this era of technology, anyone who doesn’t rely on it won't be able to keep up with the competition. Not only startups or small businesses, even industry giants have to play by this rule.

As an entrepreneur, chances are you already understand this phenomenon and want to look for tools to boost your business. Tech-based tools can aid in various aspects of a business. You can find tools for enhancing SEO, customer relationships, and event management, amongst other things.

If existing apps do not serve your purpose, you can also build custom ones with the help of **low-code tool**s. Wholeheartedly investing in a business's digital aspects will never let you down in this fast-paced economy. But if you need help figuring out where to start, this article should give you some ideas.


**Powerful tool**s can help you manage things from a macro level, like resource allocations, to macro-level things, like POS. But established large businesses integrating digitalized systems are different from fledgling startups. Your goal is not about polishing out the finer details like the industry giants; instead, it's about stabilizing your business.

Here are some tools that can immensely help with that:

## 1. Illa

While there are countless software options for managing various aspects of a growing business, each business is unique. As an entrepreneur, you surely realize that some parts of your business need more customized software solutions.

Hiring qualified coders to build software from scratch is daunting for most startups. That's where **low-code platforms** like Illa come in. With Illa, you can create small tools in literal minutes without needing extensive **coding skills**.

This **low-code tool** is very flexible due to its extensive UI library for developers. It also enhances development speed by making use of its database integration. Illa can also seamlessly synthesize front and back-end data to increase productivity.

Illa also has a beneficial project-sharing feature. With this, you can have multiple people working on the same project by sharing the relevant link. You can exchange real-time suggestions and feedback while co-editing software.

While many **low-code development platform**s exist, Illa is more client-oriented than others. It offers plenty of freedom to developers to efficiently create complex software tools. For a startup, efficiency is necessary for growth.

## 2.Zoho CRM

For any startup, customer relationship management is crucial. The core of any business idea requires much deliberation and careful handling. Assigning a few people to manage these aspects is not viable for most startups or small businesses.

That's where CRM-focused software like Zoho CRM comes into play. Zoho CRM is arguably one of the best CRM software currently available. It is reliable, has excellent technical support, and offers many beneficial features for the current work environment.

Zoho CRM also doubles as an analytic software that you may use to monitor sales volume. It has cross-platform support and a built-in communication module. This feature is perfect for employees working from home, as they can keep updated on everything.

Zoho CRM is also quite famous for its user interface. It is easy software to use and integrate into your other business-related apps and **third-party applications**. It can also help you keep track of leads with individual records and has built-in motivator systems that make routine and mundane tasks more rewarding for your employees.

One of the things that people look for while choosing CRM software is its automatic functions. Zoho CRM is ranked top because it has vastly superior AI-assisted features to increase **workflow automation**.

## 3. Google Analytics

Every business that relies on the internet needs to care about SEO. And with the fast-paced, information-driven economy, startups must rely on online platforms for publicity. Making a website is only half the equation; you must meticulously manage it to see progress.

You will need to analyze the website traffic to determine what to change. A website analyzing tool is crucial for that task. Google Analytics is a simple tool that lets you analyze website traffic. It will show you simple and compact statistics detailing your website engagement. You can use google analytics to study visitor behaviors.

Studying visitor behavior will allow you to increase your sales efficiency. You can optimize your SEO using the data provided by Google Analytics to boost your website's rating.

With this tool, you can see how many people visit your website, how long they stay, and what content they engage with. You can also see the bounce rate of your visitors- people who only viewed one page. You can plan accordingly and put more interlinks on those pages to see significantly better results.

Google Analytics is highly suitable for startups because it is very affordable. The interface is beginner-friendly, so you won't require much tech knowledge to use this tool. In short, you will gain access to a lot of business intelligence with this tool without needing much technical skill.

## 4. Hootsuite

More than a website is needed to utilize the online platform to boost your business entirely. Social media engagement is key to generating organic leads from any platform. Some small businesses can thrive just with their social media influence alone.

But cultivating a favorable social media profile for a business can be a rather tiresome task. It's not hard to push out new content, but consistency is more important than quality. You need to engage your audience and push out content regularly.

Doing that is often impossible for startups since they don't always have spare manpower. That's where social media organizer software like Hootsuite comes in.

Hootsuite is a social media management tool requiring zero technical knowledge. This tool is relatively simple, as there are no complicated features. You can use it to schedule social media content for a delayed post. Doing so will help you maintain regularity between each upload and save you a lot of hassle.

Additionally, you can use this tool to see how your audience engages with your content. It works like a mini analytic tool that monitors and gives statistics on social media activity.

## 5. Management- Trello

Management is the backbone of keeping a business running. You may think you have a very effective management system, but most of the time, there's a chance to improve. Even companies that follow a **traditional development** route find new tech-based management tools very helpful.

Trello is a powerful tool that can help you work more organized. It is a project management software that allows workflow automation. It has a popular mobile app with a helpful interface and cross-platform support.

You can use Trello to draw up scheduled tasks and assignments. You can share work files and even comment on projects. The manager can use it to assign tasks to individual members and keep track of who has which job.

While Trello is handy immediately, you can boost its capabilities further through **third-party applications**. You can also integrate it with your existing **business apps** and use a shared platform.

While Trello falls a bit short compared to **enterprise-grade applications**, it is still more than enough for startups and medium-sized businesses.

# Conclusion

After reading this article, hopefully, you've found some helpful inspiration to take your startup to the next level. In this fast-growing trend of the business world, the more tools you have at your disposal, the better.

Even the slightest edge over your competitor can help your revenue. Management tools, **low code tool**s, or even generic POS tools can significantly boost your business.

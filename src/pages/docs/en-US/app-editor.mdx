### Toolbar
The Toolbar is located at the top of the APP Editor which is used mainly to configure the APP and can be used for the following tasks：

  - View APP information and save status.
  - Show/hide items left, right, lower panel.
  - Adjusting the scaling of items.
  - Show all current developers of the APP.

### Frame
Frame is the area of the APP where you can edit the graphical interface of the APP. You can drag and drop inserts into the frame from the inserts panel on the right hand side; you can also select inserts that have been placed into the frame and use the mouse to drag and drop to modify the position and size of the inserts. When you are dragging and dropping inserts or modifying their size, a dashed square will appear in the background of the frame to help you to arrange the inserts neatly in the frame. When you encounter overlapping inserts while dragging and dropping, ILLA Builder will give priority to the insert you are moving and automatically move the blocking insert out of the way for you.

#### Preview
The preview toggle button is located in the top right corner of the frame . When clicked, the editor will enter preview mode, the lower left and right panels will be hidden and the inserts in the frame will not be modified, all inserts will be presented in front of you in 1:1 size.

>### Browsers supported
We recommend that you open ILLA Builder in Google Chrome.

### 配置面板
配置面板位于画布下方，是您书写代码用于与资源交互数据的区域。您可以在该区域查找已创建Action、选择当前Action资源、书写查询语句、设置Transformer。您可以在配置面板中编辑查询语句，当您更新了查询语句后，项目编辑器会自动更新您的查询结果。在输入SQL查询语句时，您可以选择使用SQL模式通过纯代码进行编辑，也可以选择GUI模式在我们给出的查询框架下进行修改，快速完成Action编辑。详细的Action教程请查看[Action文档]()

### Action Editor
The Action Editor is located below the frame and is the area where you write code to interact with data from resources. In this area you can find created operations, select the current operational resource, write query statements and set up transformers.

### Data Workspace
The Data Workspace is located in the panel to the left of the frame, where you can view the inserts, actions and global status of the editor, all displayed in Json format. You can also edit the data by selecting it in the workspace or delete it by clicking on the More settings button.

### Insert
The Insert is located in the panel to the right of the frame and you can move the insert to the frame by dragging and dropping it with the mouse. You can find the insert you need by insert type, or you can search for it and find it quickly.

### Inspect
Inspect is located in the panel to the right of the frame. When you select an insert in the frame or data workspace, the panel to the right will automatically switch to the insert page. From this page you can set variables, update the insert name, create event handlers or perform an insert delete operation. The toolbar of the insert will also be set differently for different inserts, so that you can change the content of the different inserts.

### Choose your data

You can use actions and transformers to build charts. You can reference an array or an object in the **Data source** field for a chart. 

After you select a data source, ILLA parses the data and populates the chart. By default, the first non-numeric column populates the **X-axis** but you can change this and other properties like **Chart type**, **Group by**, etc.


### Supported data structures

The Chart component requires data in a tabular format. This can either be an array of objects, where every object field is a column, or as an object where each key represents a column and the value is an array of values for that column.

### Group data

One common use case is to chart time series data for a dynamic number of groups. For example, grouping revenue by product or headcount by team. Use the **Group by** property to choose a field from your data source to group and display this kind of data.

To see an example of this, create a JavaScript transformer using the code below. Make sure to save and run it before continuing.

Add a Chart component to the Canvas and set its **Data source**
 to the transformer you created. Change the chart type to **Line chart**
 and set **Group by**
 to `animal`
. The chart now shows the number of animals over time. If you add more data points to the transformer, the chart updates automatically.

### Transformation types

ILLA supports two transformation types:

- **Group by**: Group the **data** by a specific column.
- **Aggregation**: Summarize the values for a group.
    
    You can use the following methods to aggregate data.

## <h2 hidden>Custom API authentication</h2>

ILLA supports many authentication standards by default (see here for more information). 
Additionally, ILLA has a Custom Auth authentication mode that allows you to combine multiple steps supporting virtually any API authentication. 
These authentication methods can be used for both REST and GraphQL resources.

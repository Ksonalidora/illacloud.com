title: ILLA CLI
description: The ILLA CLI enables you to deploy ILLA Builder faster than your imagination.
---

**You must have Docker before using the ILLA CLI to deploy a self-hosted installation.**

## Downloading ILLA CLI
If you have Rust installed, you can easily build+install the latest ILLA CLI release with `cargo`:
``` 
> cargo install illa
```
The `cargo` tool will complete downloading the ILLA CLI with its source dependencies, build and install it into the cargo bin path so that we can run it.
Once installed, you can run the ILLA CLI with the `illa` command.

Alternatively, you can just download the ILLA CLI for your operating system here:

* [Windows](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)
* [Linux](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)
* [Mac](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)

Downloading the ILLA CLI from the link above is slightly different to the one from cargo. After downloading the CLI, you have to make it executable. Let's take cli-linux as an example.

## Checking the prerequisites of self-hosted installation

**These ports 5432, 9999 and 8000 should remain for the ILLA Builder**

The following command will check the prerequisites of self-hosted installation on your operating system:
```
> illa doctor
```

## Deploying ILLA Builder
Once the ILLA CLI has been installed, you can run a self-hosted or cloud installation.

**The cloud installation of ILLA Builder is coming soon**

You can simply deploy a self-hosted ILA Builder by running the following command:

```
# the port which ILLA Builder can be accessed on can be changed
> illa deploy --self --port=10000 
```
Now, you can access the ILLA Builder: http://localhost:10000

## Updating ILLA Builder
To update the ILLA Builder with the latest docker images, use the following command:
```
> illa update --self
```

## Other operations
```
# list the ILLA Builder
> illa list --self

# stop the ILLA Builder
> illa stop --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# remove the ILLA Builder and the persistent data
> illa remove --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# restart the ILLA Builder
> illa restart --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# help information
> illa help
```

### What is ILLA
ILLA is a low-code platform that lets developers build internal tools in minutes, and spend less time on website design and integrations.

### Why choose ILLA

#### A fully responsive UI library
We have built dozens of components in ILLA Builder to meet the needs of developers in different scenarios. Developers can drag and drop to boost their productivity, which greatly saves the time on building internal tools
#### Integrate with any data source and take action
ILLA can connect to the mainstream databases or any data that can be connected through APIs and add actions to chain to user events. It tightly integrates the data obtained from the back-end with the front-end components, allowing developers to write simple data calls to achieve massive information interaction.
#### Built for Developers
We offer developers a high degree of freedom to implement richer functionality through JavaScript, wrapping JS statements with {{Template Syntax}} to place JS in any string type variable space for more variety in the output
#### Collaborate with any developer at any time
ILLA turns imagination into real codes and designs. Developers can work simultaneously in ILLA Builder by sharing links. They can co-edit and communicate with other developers in real-time to give timely feedback, which will greatly improve development efficiency.
#### Meet the deployment needs of all types of developers
ILLA provides two ways to deploy. Developers can use the ILLA Cloud to quickly start building their apps on any device. We also provide ILLA CLI for free with better security to ensure data safety.

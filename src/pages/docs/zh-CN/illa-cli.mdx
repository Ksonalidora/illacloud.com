description: The ILLA CLI help deploys the ILLA Builder as fast as you can imagine.

**You must have Docker before using the ILLA CLI to deploy a self-hosted installation.**

## Downloading ILLA CLI
If you have Rust installed, you can easily build+install the latest ILLA CLI release with `cargo`
``` 
> cargo install illa
```
The `cargo` tool will do the work of downloading ILLA CLI and its source dependencies, building it, and installing it into the cargo bin path so we can run it.

Once installed, we can run ILLA CLI using the `illa` command.

Alternatively, you can just download the ILLA CLI for your operating system here:

* [Windows](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)
* [Linux](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)
* [Mac](https://github.com/illa-family/illa)

If you do download from the above links, the steps are slightly different compared to downloading the ILLA CLI from `cargo`. After downloading the CLI, you will have to make it executable. Let's take the cli-linux for example:

## Checking the prerequisites of self-hosted installation

**These ports 5432, 9999 and 8000 should remain for the ILLA Builder**

The following command will check the prerequisites of self-hosted installation on your operating system:
```
> illa doctor
```

## Deploying ILLA Builder
Once the ILLA CLI is installed, users can run a self-hosted or cloud installation.

**The cloud installation of ILLA Builder is coming soon**

Just simply run the following command to deploy a self-hosted ILLA Builder:

```
> illa deploy --self --port=10000 #the port which ILLA Builder can be accessed on can be changed
```
Now, you can access the ILLA Builder: http://localhost:10000

## Updating ILLA Builder
To update the ILLA Builder with the latest docker images, use the following command:
```shell
> illa update --self
```

## Other operations
```
# list the ILLA Builder
> illa list --self

# stop the ILLA Builder
> illa stop --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# remove the ILLA Builder and the persistent data
> illa remove --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# restart the ILLA Builder
> illa restart --id=<ILLA_BUILDER_CONTAINER_ID> --self

# help information
> illa help
```
